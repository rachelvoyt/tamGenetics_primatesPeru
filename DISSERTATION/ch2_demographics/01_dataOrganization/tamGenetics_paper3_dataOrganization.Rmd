# 1 Overview

This document is a record of all the steps involved in cleaning the
saddleback and emperor tamarin demography data from 2009 to 2023.

Data sources used to assemble the demography dataset include:

-   Excel sheets provided by Mini & Gideon listing individuals captured
    from 2009-2019 & 2021-2023
-   Trapping sheets - provides morphometrics and health metrics for
    individuals captured
-   Capture reports - provides additional detail on captures, including
    group size (especially helpful when not all individuals are
    captured)
-   The FPI database - should include the same information as the
    capture sheets and reports, but good to check for consistency

Data cleaning steps include:

1.  Combine and reformat capture records
    1.  Combine excel sheets for 2009-2019 and 2021-2023 individual
        captures and reformat columns to reflect desired variables
    2.  Export as **captureData_2009to2023_v1.csv**
2.  OpenRefine cleaning
    1.  Import captureData_2009to2023_v1.csv to OpenRefine
    2.  Standardize value names (e.g., species names, group names, etc.)
    3.  Export as **captureData_2009to2023_v2.csv**
3.  Finalize captureData_byIndiv to upload to Google Sheets
    1.  Import captureData_2009to2023_v2.csv to R
    2.  Ensure microchips are read as characters & subset capture data
        to include only LWED and SIMP entries
    3.  Export as **captureData_2009to2023_v3.csv**
4.  Google sheets cleaning

# 2 Packages

```{r}
library(data.table)
library(janitor)
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
```

# 3 Prep raw data

## 3.1 Reformat & combine raw data

Individual capture data currently exists in two files, one from
2009-2019 and the other from 2021-2023

```{r}
captures_2009.2019_byIndiv <- read.csv("./paper3_demographics/01_dataOrganization/01_dataOriginal/tamarin_captures_2009-2019.csv", na.strings = c("", "NA"))

captures_2021.2023_byIndiv <- read.csv("./paper3_demographics/01_dataOrganization/01_dataOriginal/tamarin_captures_2021-2023.csv", na.strings = c("", "NA"))
```

For the captureData_byIndiv datasheet, we need the following column
names:

```{r}
colNames_captures_byIndiv <- c(
  'reviewedInitials',
  'reviewedDate',
  'captureDate',
  'captureID',
  'species',
  'groupName',
  'groupID',
  'ageClass',
  'sex',
  'animalName',
  'animalID',
  'trappingID',
  'microchip',
  'weightTotal',
  'weightBag',
  'weightAnimal',
  'testesVulva_length',
  'testesVulva_width',
  'spGland_length',
  'spGland_width',
  'nippleR_length',
  'nippleL_length',
  'dentitionState',
  'notes',
  'links'
)
```

Using these column names, we can reformat and combine the 2009-2019 &
2021-2023 capture sheets:

```{r}
# Reformat captures_2009.2019_byIndiv
captures_2009.2019_byIndiv_updated <- data.frame(matrix(ncol = length(colNames_captures_byIndiv), nrow = length(captures_2009.2019_byIndiv$X), dimnames = list(NULL, colNames_captures_byIndiv))) %>%
  mutate(
    reviewedInitials = "",
    reviewedDate = "",
    captureDate = captures_2009.2019_byIndiv$CaptureDate,
    captureID = "",
    species = captures_2009.2019_byIndiv$Species,
    groupName = captures_2009.2019_byIndiv$GroupName,
    groupID = captures_2009.2019_byIndiv$GroupID,
    ageClass = captures_2009.2019_byIndiv$Age_class,
    sex = captures_2009.2019_byIndiv$Sex,
    animalName = captures_2009.2019_byIndiv$AnimalName,
    animalID = captures_2009.2019_byIndiv$AnimalID,
    trappingID = captures_2009.2019_byIndiv$CaptureNo.,
    microchip = captures_2009.2019_byIndiv$Microchip,
    weightTotal = "",
    weightBag = "",
    weightAnimal = "",
    testesVulva_length = "",
    testesVulva_width = "",
    spGland_length = "",
    spGland_width = "",
    nippleR_length = "",
    nippleL_length = "",
    dentitionState = "",
    notes = "",
    links = ""
  ) %>%
  select(all_of(colNames_captures_byIndiv)) %>%
  mutate(originalData = "tamarin_captures_2009-2019.csv")

# Reformat captures_2021.2023_byIndiv
captures_2021.2023_byIndiv_updated <- data.frame(matrix(ncol = length(colNames_captures_byIndiv), nrow = length(captures_2021.2023_byIndiv$ID), dimnames = list(NULL, colNames_captures_byIndiv))) %>%
  mutate(
    reviewedInitials = "",
    reviewedDate = "",
    captureDate = captures_2021.2023_byIndiv$CaptureDate,
    captureID = "",
    species = captures_2021.2023_byIndiv$Species,
    groupName = captures_2021.2023_byIndiv$group,
    groupID = "",
    ageClass = captures_2021.2023_byIndiv$age,
    sex = captures_2021.2023_byIndiv$sex,
    animalName = captures_2021.2023_byIndiv$animal_name,
    animalID = captures_2021.2023_byIndiv$animal_ID,
    trappingID = captures_2021.2023_byIndiv$capture_number,
    microchip = captures_2021.2023_byIndiv$Microchip,
    weightTotal = "",
    weightBag = "",
    weightAnimal = "",
    testesVulva_length = "",
    testesVulva_width = "",
    spGland_length = "",
    spGland_width = "",
    nippleR_length = "",
    nippleL_length = "",
    dentitionState = "",
    notes = "",
    links = ""
  ) %>%
  select(all_of(colNames_captures_byIndiv)) %>%
  mutate(originalData = "tamarin_captures_2020-2023.csv")

# Combined capture records
captures_2009.2023_byIndiv <- rbind(captures_2009.2019_byIndiv_updated, captures_2021.2023_byIndiv_updated)
```

Then export the combined data file for input into OpenRefine for
additional cleaning:

```{r}
write.csv(captures_2009.2023_byIndiv, "./paper3_demographics/01_dataOrganization/02_dataCleaning/captureData_2009to2023_byIndiv_v1.csv", row.names = F)
```

## 3.2 Filter post OpenRefine

I cleaned up a lot of the column entries in OpenRefine, including the
species column -- now that LWED/SIMP entries now have these values (as
opposed to SFUS, Saguinus weddelli, etc.) in the species column, we can
filter to just these entries:

```{r}
captures_2009.2023_v2 <- read.csv("./paper3_demographics/01_dataOrganization/02_dataCleaning/captureData_2009to2023_byIndiv_v2.csv") %>%
  # make sure microchips are read as text vs. numbers
  mutate(
    microchip1 = as.character(microchip1),
    microchip2 = as.character(microchip2),
    microchip3 = as.character(microchip3)
  )

captures_2009.2023_v3 <- captures_2009.2023_v2 %>%
  filter(species %in% c("LWED", "SIMP"))
```

OUTPUT: **captureData_2009to2023_byIndiv_v3.csv**; export for entry into
the tamGenetics_demographics_dataCleaning Google sheet

```{r}
write.csv(captures_2009.2023_v3, "./paper3_demographics/01_dataOrganization/02_dataCleaning/captureData_2009to2023_byIndiv_v3.csv", row.names = F)
```

## 3.3 captureData_byGroup template

Using captures_2009.2023_v3, we can also get a starting point for the
captureData_byGroup sheet on tamGenetics_demographics_dataCleaning:

```{r}
captures_2009.2023_byGroup <- captures_2009.2023_v3 %>%
  select(c("captureDate", "species", "groupName", "groupID")) %>%
  distinct()

write.csv(captures_2009.2023_byGroup, "./paper3_demographics/01_dataOrganization/02_dataCleaning/captureData_2009to2023_byGroup_v1.csv", row.names = F)
```

# 4 Clean data

## 4.1 captureData_byIndiv

### Clean step #1 (COMPLETE)

Input: **captureData_2009to2023_byIndiv_v3.csv** Output: edited on Google sheet
only (no csv file)

Cleaning step 1 was completed by Maddy in Google Sheets, where she did
line-by-line checks of individual capture data against the original
capture reports and trapping sheets.

### Clean step #2 (IN PROGRESS)

Input: Google sheet only (no csv file) Output: after Gideon has finished
going through things, export as
**captureData_2009to2023_byIndiv_v4.csv**

After Maddy finished going through all the data in Google Sheets, I went
through the data again to check for errors/inconsistencies, tagging
Gideon where needed to address anything that I couldn't reconcile.

My own checks include a quick check in R to ensure that each animalID
was consistently assigned the same species and sex, which I did using
the captureData_byIndividual Google Sheet from 8 February 2024 (now
archived).

I found two animalIDs with inconsistent sex assignments (species
assignments were fine though):

Issue #1 - animalID 116 (GBY) has both F & M entries Issue #2 - animalID
234 (YBG3) also has both F & M entries

After reviewing data sheets, both should be M; both are entered
correctly on my original md file. I also updated both on the Google
sheet.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
capData_byIndiv_8Feb2024 <- read.csv("./paper3_demographics/01_dataOrganization/archived/tamGenetics_demographics_dataCleaning_captureData_byIndividual_8Feb2024.csv")

dupTest_spSex_8Feb2024 <- capData_byIndiv_8Feb2024 %>%
  select(c(animalID, species, sex)) %>%
  arrange(animalID) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  group_by(animalID) %>%
  filter(n() > 1) %>%
  summarize(n=n())

# examine animalIDs 116 & 234
dupTest_spSex_8Feb2024_troubleshooting <- capData_byIndiv_8Feb2024 %>%
  filter(animalID %in% c(116, 234))
```

### Clean step #3: Microchips (COMPLETE)

#### Data

##### capData_byIndiv_v4

Use the final cleaned version from Google Sheets - the very final
cleaned copy should be named captureData_2009to2023_byIndiv_v4.csv, but
since Clean step #2 isn't completely finished (Gideon needs to go
through things), just use the latest version available

```{r}
capData_byIndiv_v4 <- read.csv("./paper3_demographics/01_dataOrganization/captureData_byIndividual_20May2024.csv", na.strings = c("", "NA")) %>%
  # create rowID corresponding to google sheet for easy reference
  mutate(rowID = row_number()) %>%
  relocate(rowID) %>%
  # remove entries marked to discard
  filter(discardEntry != "yes") %>%
  # provide non-NA value for entries missing animalID or microchip
  mutate(
    animalID = case_when(
      is.na(as.character(animalID)) ~ "UNK",
      .default = as.character(animalID)
    ),
    microchip1 = case_when(
      is.na(microchip1) ~ "UNK",
      .default = microchip1
    )
  ) %>%
  # sort by animalID, then captureDate
  arrange(animalID, captureDate)
```

##### microchips_capData

Microchips from googleSheet-cleaned captureData_byIndiv - note that
entries missing animalID or microchip have those values replaced by
"unk"

```{r}
microchips_capData_v1 <- capData_byIndiv_v4 %>%
  select(c(rowID, animalID, microchip1, microchip2, microchip3)) %>%
  # replace missing animalID/microchip values with "unk"
  mutate(
    animalID = case_when(
      is.na(as.character(animalID)) ~ "UNK",
      .default = as.character(animalID)
    ),
    microchip1 = case_when(
      is.na(microchip1) ~ "UNK",
      .default = microchip1
      )
  ) %>%
  # make sure microchips are read as text vs. numbers
  mutate(
    microchip1 = as.character(microchip1),
    microchip2 = as.character(microchip2),
    microchip3 = as.character(microchip3)
  ) %>%
  pivot_longer(!c(rowID, animalID),
               names_to = "microchipVersion",
               values_to = "microchip") %>%
#  select(-microchipVersion) %>%
  # remove NAs introduced by pivot
  na.omit() %>%
  # create animalID.microchip combo variable
  mutate(
    animalID.microchip = str_c(animalID, as.character(microchip), sep = "_")
  ) %>%
  relocate(microchipVersion, .after = rowID) %>%
  arrange(rowID)

# old stuff:
#  group_by(animalID.microchip) %>%
#  count() %>%
#  separate(animalID.microchip, into = c("animalID", "microchip"), sep = "_", remove = F) %>%
#  select(c(rowID, animalID, microchip, animalID.microchip, n)) %>%
#  merge(., as.data.frame(table(capData_byIndiv_v4$animalID)), by.x = "animalID", by.y = "Var1") %>%
#  dplyr::rename("n_chip" = "n",
#                "n_captures" = "Freq") %>%
#  arrange(animalID)
```

##### microchips_fpiData

Need to load in full FPI database and subset to tamarins

```{r}
# had to export database as multiple pages; import all & recombine
fpiData_p1 <- read.csv("./paper3_demographics/01_dataOrganization/01_dataOriginal/fpi_animal-list_page1.csv")
fpiData_p2 <- read.csv("./paper3_demographics/01_dataOrganization/01_dataOriginal/fpi_animal-list_page2.csv")
fpiData_p3 <- read.csv("./paper3_demographics/01_dataOrganization/01_dataOriginal/fpi_animal-list_page3.csv")
fpiData_p4 <- read.csv("./paper3_demographics/01_dataOrganization/01_dataOriginal/fpi_animal-list_page4.csv")

fpiData_full <- rbind(fpiData_p1, fpiData_p2, fpiData_p3, fpiData_p4)

# export full list to have on hand
write.csv(fpiData_full, "./paper3_demographics/01_dataOrganization/01_dataOriginal/fpi_animal-list_full.csv", row.names = F)

# subset data
## typo check - have Primate and Primates
table(fpiData_full$order)

## filter to Primates & correct typo
fpiData_primates <- fpiData_full %>%
  filter(order %in% c("Primate", "Primates")) %>%
  mutate(order = "Primates")

## typo check - just Callitrichidae, no typos
table(fpiData_primates$family)

## filter to Callitrichidae
fpiData_tams <- fpiData_primates  %>%
  filter(family == "Callitrichidae")

## typo check - have Leontocebus weddeli, Leontocebus weddelli, and Saguinus imperator
table(fpiData_tams$species)

## filter to lwed & simp & switch species to short-name & add rowID
fpiData_tams2 <- fpiData_tams %>%
  filter(species %in% c("Leontocebus weddeli",
                        "Leontocebus weddelli",
                        "Saguinus imperator")) %>%
  mutate(
    species = case_when(
      species == "Leontocebus weddeli" ~ "LWED",
      species == "Leontocebus weddelli" ~ "LWED",
      species == "Saguinus imperator" ~ "SIMP"
    )
  ) %>%
  arrange(as.numeric(animal_id)) %>%
  mutate(
    rowID = row_number()
  ) %>%
  relocate(rowID)

## select animalID/microchips variables only
microchips_fpiData_v1 <- fpiData_tams2 %>%
  select(rowID, animal_id, microchip_band_tag) %>%
  dplyr::rename("animalID" = "animal_id",
                "microchip" = "microchip_band_tag") %>%
  # replace missing animalID/microchip values with "unk"
  mutate(
    animalID = case_when(
      is.na(as.character(animalID)) ~ "UNK",
      .default = as.character(animalID)
    ),
    microchip = case_when(
      microchip == "NO CHIP" ~ "UNK",
      microchip == "NONE" ~ "UNK",
      microchip == "NULL" ~ "UNK",
      microchip == "UNK?" ~ "UNK",
      .default = microchip
      )
  ) %>%
  # separate any combined microchips
  separate("microchip", c("microchip1", "microchip2", "microchip3"), sep = "/") %>%
  # make sure microchips are read as text vs. numbers
  mutate(
    microchip1 = as.character(microchip1),
    microchip2 = as.character(microchip2),
    microchip3 = as.character(microchip3)
  ) %>%
  pivot_longer(!c(rowID, animalID),
               names_to = "microchipVersion",
               values_to = "microchip") %>%
#  select(-microchipVersion) %>%
  # remove NAs introduced by pivot
  na.omit() %>%
  mutate(
    animalID.microchip = str_c(animalID, as.character(microchip), sep = "_")
  ) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  relocate(microchipVersion, .after = rowID) %>%
  arrange(rowID)
```

##### microchips_masterList_v1

We can combine all of the animalID/microchip data above to create a
master list of all unique animalID/microchip combos found in both
capData and fpiData, with additional columns to note whether the
combination is found in capData, fpiData, or both.

```{r}
microchips_masterList_v1 <- rbind(
  microchips_capData_v1 %>% select(animalID.microchip),
  microchips_fpiData_v1 %>% select(animalID.microchip)
) %>%
  # ensure all letters are uppercase
  mutate(animalID.microchip = toupper(animalID.microchip)) %>%
  # remove duplicates
  distinct() %>%
  # recreate separate animalID & microchip variables
  mutate(
    animalID = str_split_i(animalID.microchip, "_", i = 1),
    microchip = str_split_i(animalID.microchip, "_", i = 2)
  ) %>%
  select(animalID, microchip, animalID.microchip) %>%
  arrange(animalID) %>%
  # note whether combo appears in capData, fpiData, or both
  mutate(
    in_capData = case_when(
      animalID.microchip %in% microchips_capData_v1$animalID.microchip ~ "yes",
      .default = "no"
    ),
    in_fpiData = case_when(
      animalID.microchip %in% microchips_fpiData_v1$animalID.microchip ~ "yes",
      .default = "no"
    ),
    in_both = case_when(
      in_capData == "yes" & in_fpiData == "yes" ~ "yes",
      .default = "no"
    )
  )
```

#### dupChecks

Now that we have a full list of animalIDs/microchips from both capData
and fpiData, the first cleaning step is to check whether any microchips
have been assigned to multiple animalIDs.

##### Identify duplicates

In total, there are 4 microchips that have been assigned to more than
one animalID:

-   **4C31275328** to animalIDs 25 and 98
-   **4C33045515** to animalIDs 63 and 156
-   **7E10234910** to animalIDs 234 and 535
-   **933000320126286** to animalIDs 15 and 32

```{r}
microchips_dupChecks <- microchips_masterList_v1 %>%
  # remove entries w/NA animalID or microchip
  filter(!str_detect(animalID.microchip, "UNK")) %>%
  # check for dupes
  get_dupes(microchip) %>%
  select(animalID, microchip, animalID.microchip) %>%
  merge(., data.frame(table(microchips_capData_v1$animalID.microchip)), by.x = "animalID.microchip", by.y = "Var1", all.x = T) %>%
  dplyr::rename("n_chip" = "Freq") %>%
  merge(., data.frame(table(capData_byIndiv_v4$animalID)), by.x = "animalID", by.y = "Var1", all.x = T) %>%
  dplyr::rename("n_captures" = "Freq") %>%
  arrange(microchip, as.numeric(animalID))

microchips_dupChecks %>%
  distinct(microchip) %>%
  nrow()
```

##### Assess

**MicrochipID 4C31275328: 25, 98**

-   fpiData for animalID 25 says not to use those records and instead
    use those for animalID 98

UPDATES:

-   25_4C31275328 - remove
-   also remove any other entries for animalID 25

```{r}
microchipError_4C31275328_fpiData <- fpiData_microchipPresent %>%
  filter(animal_id %in% c("25", "98"))
```

**Microchip 4C33045515: 63, 156**

-   animalID 63 - listed for for 6/7 captures
-   animalID 156 - listed for 1/5 captures
-   In the Google Sheet, the relevant entry for animalID 156 (rowID 498)
    the microchip for the relevant google sheet entry for animalID 156
    is highlighted yellow; no comments, but I'm going to go ahead and
    assume this was a copy/paste error or some such

UPDATES:

-   156_4C33045515 - remove
-   156_0A02356657 - add

```{r}
microchipError_4C33045515_capData <- capData_byIndiv_v4 %>%
  filter(animalID %in% c("63", "156"))
```

**Microchip 7E10234910: 234, 535**

-   animalID 234 - listed for 2/2 captures
-   animalID 535 - listed for 1/2 captures

Oof complicated. Same group (Illest), same species (LWED)... is this the
same individual?? 234 = YBG3 535 = YBG3, YBG4

OKAY - after looking at all of the trapping sheets and reports for 234
and 535, I've determined that this is the SAME individual. Part of the
issue likely has to do with the 2021 capture, where they had a microchip
reader issue and ended up inserting outdated microchips. This individual
received the following microchips in the following years:

-   2018 (234) - 7E10234910 (trapping sheet missing, but listed as an
    old microchip in trapping sheets from more recent years)
-   2019 (535) - 933000320126306
-   2021 (535) - 0A02357926
-   2023 (234) - 933000320617489

**note** that the fpi data for LWED YBG individuals doesn't seem to be
correct for this individual? Lists animalID 535 as "unknown Illest adult
first captured in 2019" w/microchips "0a02357926/933000320126306"

UPDATES:

-   in capData, append "animalID 234 & 535 are the SAME indiv - changed
    animalID here from 535 to 234" to notes_RV
-   then change animalID 535 to 234 - note that this means this indiv
    has 4 unique microchip IDs total

```{r}
microchipError_7E10234910_capData <- capData_byIndiv_v4 %>%
  filter(animalID %in% c("234", "535"))

fpiData_lwedYBG <- fpiData_tams2 %>%
  filter(species == "LWED") %>%
  filter(str_detect(animal_name, "YBG"))
```

**MicrochipID 933000320126286: 15, 32**

-   animalID 15 = SIMP_F, SRC/SPS, 48585E5774/933000320126286
-   animalID 32 = SIMP_M, RBL, 4903445A51/933000320126286

The fpiData has no notes, no capture dates; each has another microchipID
available, but both still have the common microchip listed as well.

From the Google sheet captureData_byIndividual records, I have the
following notes for animalID 15/rowID 594: "the '..26286' belongs to the
individual in the row just above this one; current individual's trapping
sheet lists"new" microchip '..26274' and "new new" microchip '..26285' -
there's no trapping report or other further info available in the folder
(w/o going through the mp3)"

Looking at the individual capture records, 933000320126286 is only
associated with RBL (animalID 32); trapping reports further support,
stating that RBL was given this new microchip on 29 June 2019. As such,
I'm going to move forward with the assumption that it belongs only to
animalID 32, and NOT to animalID 15.

I'm still not entirely sure if 93300032012628***5*** is a legit
microchip for animalID 15, but am fairly certain that
93300032012628***6*** is **not**. As such, I'm going to swap the 6 to a
5 for animalID 15 and go from there.

UPDATES:

-   change 15_933000320126286 - remove
-   15_933000320126285 - add

```{r}
microchipError_933000320126286_fpiData <- fpiData_microchipPresent %>%
  filter(animal_id %in% c("15", "32"))

microchipError_933000320126286_capData <- microchips_capData %>%
  filter(animalID %in% c("15", "32"))

microchipError_933000320126286_capData <- capData_byIndiv_v4 %>%
  filter(microchip1 == "933000320126286")
```

##### Update: microchips_runningUpdates_v1

Create dataframe to track updates to original microchips_masterList_v1

        .default = NA
      )
  ) %>%
  arrange(as.numeric(animalID))
```

##### Update: microchips_capData_v2

```{r}
microchips_capData_v2 <- microchips_capData_v1 %>%
  merge(., microchips_runningUpdates_v1[, c("animalID.microchip", "action", "notes")], by = "animalID.microchip", all.x = T) %>%
  mutate(
    animalID = case_when(
      as.character(animalID) == "535" ~ "234",

    ),
    microchip = case_when(

  ) %>%
  select(rowID, microchipVersion, animalID, microchip, animalID.microchip, action, notes) %>%
  arrange(rowID) %>%
  select(-action)
```

##### Update: microchip_masterList_v2

Discard all combos marked to "remove" for a clean list of animalIDs +
associated microchips

```{r}
microchips_masterList_v2 <- microchips_runningUpdates_v1 %>%
  filter(action != "remove") %>%
  mutate(
    animalID = case_when(
      action == "update_535to234" ~ "234",
      .default = animalID
    ),
    animalID.microchip = str_c(animalID, "_", microchip)
  ) %>%
  select(-action)
```

#### Missing data

Now that we've taken care of microchips assigned to more than 1
animalID, we can address entries with a missing animalID and/or
microchip.

##### Assess

From current microchips_masterList_v2, going to create the following
lists: 1) entries with animalID, but no microchip 2) entries with
microchip, but no animalID

```{r}
microchips_missingAnimalIDs <- microchips_masterList_v2 %>%
  filter(as.character(animalID) == "UNK") %>%
  # remove any entries where microchip is also unknown
  filter(microchip != "UNK") %>%
  select(animalID, microchip, animalID.microchip)

microchips_missingMicrochips <- microchips_masterList_v2 %>%
  filter(microchip == "UNK") %>%
  # remove any entries where animalID is also unknown
  filter(as.character(animalID) != "UNK") %>%
  select(animalID, microchip, animalID.microchip)
```

Let's see how many we can fill in -

```{r}
# MISSING ANIMALIDS
## create clean master list w/no missing data
microchips_masterList_v2_clean <- microchips_masterList_v2 %>%
  filter(!str_detect(animalID.microchip, "UNK"))

## find missing animalIDs
microchips_missingAnimalIDs_found <- microchips_missingAnimalIDs %>%
  select(-animalID) %>%
  # match microchips to animalIDs
  merge(., microchips_masterList_v2_clean[, c("animalID", "microchip")], by = "microchip", all.x = T) %>%
  select(animalID, microchip, animalID.microchip) %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  arrange(as.numeric(animalID))

# MISSING MICROCHIPS
## for entries missing microchips, create list w/one microchip per animalID only
microchips_masterList_v2_clean_oneMicrochip <- microchips_masterList_v2_clean %>%
  filter(animalID %in% microchips_missingMicrochips$animalID) %>%
  select(animalID, microchip) %>%
  mutate(
    temp = as.integer(!duplicated(animalID))
  ) %>%
  filter(temp == 1) %>%
  select(-temp)

## find missing microchips
microchips_missingMicrochips_found <- microchips_missingMicrochips %>%
  select(-microchip) %>%
  merge(., microchips_masterList_v2_clean_oneMicrochip, by = "animalID", all.x = T) %>%
  select(animalID, microchip, animalID.microchip) %>%
  arrange(animalID) %>%
  na.omit()
```

What's still missing?

```{r}
# dataframes of entries still missing data
microchips_missingAnimalIDs_v2 <- microchips_missingAnimalIDs %>%
  filter(!animalID.microchip %in% microchips_missingAnimalIDs_found$animalID.microchip)

microchips_missingMicrochips_v2 <- microchips_missingMicrochips %>%
  filter(!animalID.microchip %in% microchips_missingMicrochips_found$animalID.microchip)

# list of animalID.microchip still missing data
microchips_missingData_final <- rbind(
  microchips_missingAnimalIDs_v2,
  microchips_missingMicrochips_v2
) %>%
  select(animalID.microchip)

# reformat to add back to master list later
microchips_masterList_missingData <- microchips_masterList_v2 %>%
  filter(animalID.microchip %in% microchips_missingData_final$animalID.microchip)
```

##### Update: microchips_runningUpdates_v2

Update "action" and "notes" columns for entries for which missing data
has been located

```{r}
microchips_runningUpdates_v2 <- microchips_runningUpdates_v1 %>%
  mutate(
    action = 
      case_when(
        animalID.microchip %in% microchips_missingAnimalIDs_found$animalID.microchip ~ "assign_animalID",
        animalID.microchip %in% microchips_missingMicrochips_found$animalID.microchip ~ "assign_microchip",
        .default = action
      ),
    notes = 
      case_when(
        action == "assign_animalID" ~ "animalID originally missing for this entry, but was located",
        action == "assign_microchip" ~ "microchip originally missing for this entry, but was located",
        str_detect(animalID.microchip, "UNK") & action == "keep" ~ "unable to locate missing data",
        .default = notes
      )
  ) %>%
  arrange(as.numeric(animalID))
```

##### Update: microchips_capData_v3

Update microchip list for capData w/located data

```{r}
microchips_capData_v3 <- microchips_capData_v2 %>%
  select(-notes) %>%
  # revert UNK to NA for missing animalIDs & microchips
  mutate(
    animalID = case_when(
      as.character(animalID) == "UNK" ~ NA,
      .default = as.character(animalID)
    ),
    microchip = case_when(
      microchip == "UNK" ~ NA,
      .default = microchip
    )
  ) %>%
  # update entries w/missing animalIDs
  merge(., microchips_missingAnimalIDs_found[, c("animalID.microchip", "animalID")], by = "animalID.microchip", all.x = T) %>%
  mutate(
    animalID = coalesce(animalID.x, animalID.y),
    .keep = "unused"
  ) %>%
  # update entries w/missing microchips
  merge(., microchips_missingMicrochips_found[, c("animalID.microchip", "microchip")], by = "animalID.microchip", all.x = T) %>%
  mutate(
    microchip = coalesce(microchip.x, microchip.y),
    .keep = "unused"
  ) %>%
  # update notes
  merge(., microchips_runningUpdates_v2[, c("animalID.microchip", "notes")], by = "animalID.microchip", all.x = T) %>%
  # revert NAs back to UNK
  mutate(
    animalID = case_when(
      is.na(as.character(animalID)) ~ "UNK",
      .default = as.character(animalID)
    ),
    microchip = case_when(
      is.na(microchip) ~ "UNK",
      .default = microchip
    )
  ) %>%
  # update animalID.microchip
  mutate(
    animalID.microchip = str_c(animalID, "_", microchip)
  ) %>%
  relocate(animalID.microchip, .after = microchip) %>%
  arrange(rowID)
```

##### Reassess

After updating the microchips for capData, we can check if there are any
entries that have both microchip1 and microchip2 entries but are still
missing an animalID.

We find one for capData rowID 814 - looking at the microchip1 entry for
rowID 814, we see that this belongs to animalID 8

```{r}
microchips_capData_v3 %>%
  filter(microchipVersion == "microchip2") %>%
  filter(microchip %in% microchips_masterList_missingData$microchip)

microchips_capData_v3 %>%
  filter(rowID == 814) %>%
  select(rowID, animalID, microchip)
```

It also looks like we need to put back a microchip for animalID 156 to
replace the incorrect one that we took out (see dupChecks) -- going with
156_0A02356657 since that's listed as microchip1 for 4 other entries

```{r}
microchips_capData_v3 %>%
  filter(animalID == 156)
```

##### Update: microchips_runningUpdates_v3

Update microchip running updates with animalID/microchip
8_933000320523715 (no need to add notes for 156_0A02356657; this is
already a confirmed combo)

```{r}
microchips_runningUpdates_v3 <- microchips_runningUpdates_v2 %>%
  mutate(
    action = case_when(
      microchip == "933000320523715" ~ "assign_animalID",
      .default = action
    ),
    notes = case_when(
      microchip == "933000320523715" ~ "animalID originally missing for this entry, but was located",
      .default = notes
    )
  )
```

##### Update: microchips_capData_v4

Update capData with animalID/microchip 8_933000320523715 &
156_0A02356657

```{r}
microchips_capData_v4 <- microchips_capData_v3 %>%
  mutate(
    animalID = case_when(
      microchip == "933000320523715" ~ "8",
      .default = animalID
    ),
    microchip = case_when(
      as.character(animalID) == "156" & microchip == "UNK" ~ "0A02356657",
      .default = microchip
    ),
    animalID.microchip = str_c(animalID, "_", microchip),
    notes = case_when(
      microchip == "933000320523715" ~ "animalID originally missing for this entry, but was located",
      as.character(rowID) == "498" ~ "Microchip entered incorrectly as [4C33045515], updated to [0A02356657]",
      .default = notes
    )
  )
```

##### Update: microchips_masterList_v3

For all entries EXCEPT for 8_933000320523715, we can remove the entries
for which animalIDs/microchips were found, since that means they already
exist in the master list of animalID/microchip combos - then add back in
the combos that are still unknown

```{r}
microchips_masterList_v3 <- microchips_masterList_v2_clean %>%
  rbind(.,
        microchips_masterList_missingData) %>%
  mutate(
    animalID = case_when(
      microchip == "933000320523715" ~ "8",
      .default = as.character(animalID)
    ),
    animalID.microchip = str_c(animalID, "_", microchip)
  ) %>%
  arrange(as.numeric(animalID)) %>%
  # update in_capData, in_fpiData, in_both
  mutate(
    in_capData = case_when(
      animalID.microchip %in% microchips_capData_v4$animalID.microchip ~ "yes",
      .default = "no"
    ),
    in_fpiData = case_when(
      animalID.microchip %in% microchips_fpiData_v1$animalID.microchip ~ "yes",
      .default = "no"
    ),
    in_both = case_when(
      in_capData == "yes" & in_fpiData == "yes" ~ "yes",
      .default = "no"
    )
  )
```

#### Typos & such

Now that we've taken care of microchips duplicated across animalIDs and
resolved most of the missing animalIDs/microchips, the next step is to
check for errors/typos/etc in the microchip IDs.

##### Data

**Comparison dataframe for capData vs. fpiData microchips**

The dataframe below lists all animalID/microchip combinations in both
capData and fpiData, then indicates 1) if the combo is present in
capData, fpiData, and/or both, 2) length of the microchip ID, 3) the
number of times that animalID/microchip combo appeared in capData, and
4) the total number of times that particular animalID appeared in
capData

```{r}
chipCompare_cap.fpi <- microchips_masterList_v3 %>%
  select(-notes) %>%
  # add length of microchip id
  mutate(
    nchar = nchar(microchip)
  ) %>%
  # add number of times animalID/microchip combo appeared in capData
  merge(., as.data.frame(table(microchips_capData_v4$animalID.microchip)), by.x = "animalID.microchip", by.y = "Var1", all.x = T) %>%
  dplyr::rename("n_chip" = "Freq") %>%
  # add total number of times animalID appeared in capData (total captures)
  merge(., as.data.frame(table(microchips_capData_v4$animalID)), by.x = "animalID", by.y = "Var1", all.x = T) %>%
  dplyr::rename("n_captures" = "Freq")
```

##### Assess

First I'm going to subset the comparison dataframe to animalID/microchip
combos that are unique to either capData or fpiData records + any combos
in which the microchip ID length is not either 10 or 15 characters.

In these investigations, it's important to keep in mind that microchip
numbers are usually 9-10 or 15 characters in length. Based on the
tamarin microchip numbers, it looks like microchips should either be 10
or 15 characters long.

```{r}
microchipErrors_typos_animalIDList <- chipCompare_cap.fpi %>%
  filter(in_both == "no" | !nchar %in% c(10, 15))

microchipErrors_typos <- chipCompare_cap.fpi %>%
  filter(animalID %in% microchipErrors_typos_animalIDList$animalID) %>%
  arrange(as.numeric(animalID))
```

    there's no trapping report to confirm, given that "274" is labeled
    "new" and "285" is labeled "new new" on the trapping sheet, it seems
    like there were microchip issues encountered in the field and both
    microchips ended up being used for whatever reason

    fpiData
-   0A02113564 is listed with captureDate 2013-07-14 (rowID 202);
    trapping sheet notes it as "new"; trapping report notes that female
    hadn't been trapped before and confirms microchip ID
-   0A02114707 is listed with captureDates 2014-06-17 (rowID 236) and
    2015-07-02 (rowID 327); 2014 trapping report notes that she's been
    trapped before and "has the microchip 0A02114707, confirmed with
    reader"
-   Descriptions in all trapping reports suggest this is the same
    individual (very old, rough looking)
-   My investigations don't help much, so going to move forward with the
    assumption that both microchips are valid... though might be good to
    keep in mind that animalID 46 (who was trapped the day after
    animalID 46 in 2013) has a veryyy similar microchip to our odd one
    out here (0A02114907 for 46 vs. ..707 for 45)

-   Checking full capData shows no notes indicating that these entries

Update master list with typo corrections

```{r}
microchips_masterList_v4 <- microchips_masterList_v3 %>%
  select(animalID.microchip) %>%
  merge(., microchips_typoUpdates_toRemove[, c("animalID.microchip", "new")], by = "animalID.microchip", all.x = T) %>%
  mutate(
    animalID.microchip = case_when(
      !is.na(new) ~ new,
      .default = animalID.microchip
    )
  ) %>%
  select(-new) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  separate("animalID.microchip", into = c("animalID", "microchip"), sep = "_", remove = F) %>%
  relocate(animalID.microchip, .after = microchip) %>%
  # update in_capData, in_fpiData, in_both
  mutate(
    in_capData = case_when(
      animalID.microchip %in% microchips_capData_v4$animalID.microchip ~ "yes",
      .default = "no"
    ),
    in_fpiData = case_when(

    ),
    in_both = case_when(
      in_capData == "yes" & in_fpiData == "yes" ~ "yes",
      .default = "no"
    )
  ) %>%
  arrange(as.numeric(animalID))
```

#### Update capData_byIndiv_v5

```{r}
# take notes col off then add back in after pivot
microchips_capData_v5_notesCol <- microchips_capData_v5 %>%
  select(rowID, notes) %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  distinct()

  select(rowID, microchipVersion, animalID, microchip) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = microchipVersion,
              values_from = microchip) %>%
  # move over microchip2 when microchip1 is NA
  mutate(
    microchip1 = coalesce(microchip1, microchip2)
  ) %>%
  # add notes col back in
  merge(., microchips_capData_v5_notesCol, by = "rowID", all.x = T) %>%
  dplyr::rename("notes_microchips" = "notes")

# make sure we don't have dup rowIDs
microchips_capData_v6 %>%
  select(rowID) %>%
  get_dupes(rowID)

capData_byIndiv_v5 <- capData_byIndiv_v4 %>%

  relocate(notes_microchips, .after = notes_RV)

capData_byIndiv_v5 %>%
  select(rowID) %>%
  get_dupes(rowID)
```

#### EXPORT

```{r}
# updated capData_byIndiv
write.csv(capData_byIndiv_v5, "./paper3_demographics/01_dataOrganization/captureData_byIndividual_v5.csv", row.names = F)

# all edits to microchips/animalIDs
write.csv(microchips_runningUpdates_v4 %>% arrange(as.numeric(animalID)), "./paper3_demographics/01_dataOrganization/microchipUpdates_runningList.csv", row.names = F)
```

### Clean step #4: Species & sex assignments (COMPLETE)

Now that all possible animalIDs/microchips have been assigned and
cleaned, we can do another check to make sure that species and sex
assignments are consistent for each animalID in the capture records.

Looks good - the only duplicates are for the "UNK" animalIDs.

```{r}
dupTest_spSex_capData_byIndiv_v5 <- capData_byIndiv_v5 %>%
  select(c(animalID, species, sex)) %>%
  arrange(animalID) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  group_by(animalID) %>%
  filter(n() > 1) %>%
  summarize(n=n())
```

### byIndiv

1.  Address all issues noted by MD
2.  Ensure the following variables are filled in:
    1.  captureDate
    2.  captureID
    3.  species
    4.  groupName
    5.  groupID
    6.  ageClass
    7.  sex
    8.  animalName1
    9.  animalID
    10. trappingID
    11. microchip1
    12. tailPattern
3.  Address missing data
4.  Address valid_groupName = FALSE
5.  Ensure species and sex are consistent per animalID; address
    inconsistencies

## 4.2 captureData_byGroup

### Clean step #1 (COMPLETE)

Cleaning step 1 was completed by Maddy in Google Sheets.

### Clean step #2 (IN PROGRESS)

asdf

## 4.3 nonCaptureObs

### Data entry (IN PROGRESS)

For every entry in captureData_byGroup, enter any non-captured
individuals (with as many details as are available) into the
nonCaptureObs Google sheet.

OR

just use captureData_byGroup and grab the uncaptured names for now

### Clean step #1 (IN PROGRESS)

Download and rename as **nonCaptureObs_2009to2023_v1.csv**

Assign animalIDs and other info where possible

```{r}
nonCapObs_v1 <- read.csv()
```

## 8.2 watsaDiss_data

In her dissertation (Watsa 2013), Mini has a lot of tables that contain
useful information -- I'm reproducing them here so that I can use them
in my own analyses.

In those tables, Mini uses what I refer to as the "dissID" for each
individual, which refers to the sex, group, and individual number (e.g.,
F12 = female in group 1, female number 2). I located their corresponding
groupNames & animalIDs manually for watsa_table.vi1 below, then used
that to create watsaDiss_groupKey as well as a start to
watsaDiss_indivKey so that I can add the groupNames and animalIDs to the
remaining tables as well.

**NOTE** that year 1/2/3 don't always refer to the same years in Mini's
dissertation tables!! Year 1 is either 2010 or 2011, while year 2 is
2011 or 2012 - be sure to check the table legend in the dissertation!

### watsa_table.vi1 (p. 120-121)

Mini has Table IV.1 divided into A (for LWED) and B (for SIMP); I'm
combining them into one table below.

**Note** that in this table, year1 = 2010; year2 = 2011; year3 = 2012

**Appendix IV.1A,B Known ages or estimated exact ages for individuals \<
1 year of age of A) Saguinus fuscicollis & B) Saguinus imperator,
organized by group.** (p. 120-121)

Notes from the dissertation: - The exact birthdate is known for sf_F12 &
sf_F13, 12/23/2009 - "Estimated ages are taken as the lower of the
age-bracket values for each animal, since F12 and F13 with known ages
align to this pattern." (p. 120) - "[si\_]F53 was not trapped in the
first year of her birth, but was captured the next year and is most
likely the twin of [si\_]F52." (p. 121)

## 8.2 birthYear_est

For parentage and sibship estimates, I'll be using the program FRANz.
This program can incorporate birth and death years to improve estimates
-- death years will be tricky (aside from the individual who died during
capture), but I should be able to add birth years for a decent set of
individuals.

For the sake of time, for now I'm only going to work with my tamRun5
individuals - I can go back and do the others later.

In tamRun5, I have n = 244 individuals.

### 8.2.1 Background info

#### CICRA mating/birth seasons

((all info is from Mini's dissertation unless otherwise noted))

MATING SEASON

-   April-Sep = dry season = most likely mating season

BIRTH SEASON

-   LWED = Aug-Feb (most in Oct, Dec, Jan)
-   SIMP = Nov-March (most in Nov, Dec)

According to Mini's dissertation:

-   LWED cheek patches are present up to \~7 months; fully adult facial
    coloration at 10 months
-   LWED body mass = \~154 g by 3 months; \~230 g by 6 months; \~320 g
    by 12 months
-   SIMP body mass = \~200 g by 3 months; \~290 g by 6 months; \~563 g
    by 12 months
-   SEE PAGE 95 FOR ADAPTATION OF GLASSMAN + SOINI DENTITION/AGE
    ESTIMATES (mini says she used Glassman's estimates for indivs in her
    study \<1 year old); p.99 Table IV.1D has info on canine length vs.
    months of age
-   p\. 113 says that ages of twins 7/101 (whose birthdate is known)
    "were routinely overestimated based on published schedule for
    captive-raised animals, with the actual age falling at or just below
    the lower end of the age-bracket provided by Glassman (1983)
    (Appendix IV.1A) **[[maybe this is b/c Mini converted Glassman's
    weeks to months by taking weeks/4, while I think it's more accurate
    to do (weeks\*7)/30, which gives a lower number]]**

#### Teeth eruption schedule

Mini uses Glassman's (1983) teeth eruption schedule for her ageing
estimates. In comparing estimates obtained via this schedule vs. data
from two individuals (animalIDs 7 & 101) with a known birth date,
however, she notes that their ages "were routinely overestimated based
on published schedule for captive-raised animals, with the actual age
falling at or just below the lower end of the age-bracket provided by
Glassman (1983) (Appendix IV.1A)" (p. 113). **However, I think this may
be because she converted Glassman's weeks to months by taking (weeks/4)
-- I think it's more accurate to do ((weeks x 7)/30), which gives a
lower number.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

According to Glassman (1983), saddleback tamarin teeth erupt along the
following schedule:

|            | I1    | I2    | C     | M1      | M2  | M3   |
|------------|-------|-------|-------|---------|-----|------|
| maxillary  | birth | birth | birth | 2       | 2-5 | 6-12 |
| mandibular | birth | birth | birth | birth-2 | 2-5 | 5-8  |

: Table II. Age of eruption of deciduous teeth in Saguinus fuscicollis
in weeks

|            | I1    | I2    | C     | P2    | P3    | P4    | M1    | M2    |
|------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| maxillary  | 21-23 | 23-29 | 39-45 | 32-39 | 38-39 | 29-39 | 18-23 | 29-39 |
| mandibular | 21-23 | 23-29 | 39-45 | 32-39 | 37-39 | 29-39 | 16-23 | 29-31 |

: Table III. Age of eruption of permanent teeth in Saguinus fuscicollis
in weeks

Week-day-month conversions:

-   2 weeks = 14 days
-   5 weeks = 35 days; 1.2 months
-   12 weeks = 84 days; 2.8 months
-   39 weeks = 273 days; 9.1 months [miniDiss = 9.8 months)]
-   45 weeks = 315 days; 10.5 months [miniDiss = 11.3 months]

Other notes:

-   all deciduous teeth were erupted by 12 weeks (84 days; 2.8 months)
-   first permanent tooth = M1, erupted b/t 16-23 weeks (112-161 days)
-   permanent dentition fully erupted by 45 weeks (315 days; 10.5
    months)
-   permanent canines erupted b/t 39-45 weeks (273-315 days; 9.1-10.5
    months)
-   no premolars when juv; only i1/i2/c/m1/m2/m3 (earliest premolar at
    6.8 months)
-   p2 erupts 32-39 weeks (224-273 days; 7.5-9.1 months)
-   p3 erupts 37-39 weeks (259-273 days; 8.6-9.1 months)
-   p4 erupts 29-39 weeks (203-273 days; 6.8-9.1 months)
-   deciduous M1 maxillary erupts at 2 weeks, mandibular at birth-2
    weeks
-   deciduous M2 erupts 2-5 weeks
-   deciduous M3 max erupts 6-12 weeks; M3 mand erupts 5-8 weeks
-   permanent M1 erupts maxillary 18-23 weeks; mandibular 16-23 weeks
    (126-161 days; 4.2-5.4 months)
-   permanent M2 erupts maxillary 29-39 weeks; mandibular 29-31 weeks
    (203-273 days)

Which means that:

-   any individual with all permanent: minAge = captureDate - 315 days
    (date at which permanent dentition is fully erupted)
-   any individual with all deciduous: maxAge = captureDate - 161 days
    (latest date for eruption of first permanent tooth M1)

#### capData_byIndiv

Latest version of capData_byIndiv (from current Rmd file) 1) filter to
first capture for each animalID 2) filter again to animalIDs in tamRun5

capData_byIndiv_v5 <- read.csv("./paper3_demographics/01_dataOrganization/captureData_byIndividual_v5.csv")

# filter to first capture for each animalID
capData_byIndiv_firstEntry <- capData_byIndiv_v5[match(unique(capData_byIndiv_v5$animalID), capData_byIndiv_v5$animalID),] %>%

# filter animalIDs in tamRun5
capData_byIndiv_firstEntry_tamRun5 <- capData_byIndiv_firstEntry %>%
  filter(animalID %in% md_tamRun5_v5$animalID)
```

#### capData_dentAgeDoc

I found the document 'Saguinus dentition and ageing.doc' from Google
Drive /01_dataOrganization/dataFiles_original/2009-2010_trapping/animal
Data/Saguinus dentition and ageing.doc. This document contains age info
based on dentition for individuals captured in 2009 and 2010.

To make this document more easily useable in the present context, I
created a csv file from the original doc and manually separated out the
group and animal names, adding group names when missing
(capData_saguinusDentAgeDoc_2009to2010_rvUpdates.csv). Below I'm
creating "v2" of this csv file by adding animalIDs and reformatting
slightly. I'm also creating a separate dataframe that filters out the
first entry per animalID.

```{r}
# import 'Saguinus dentition and ageing.doc', add animalIDs & reformat
capData_dentAgeDoc <- read.csv("./paper3_demographics/01_dataOrganization/capData_saguinusDentAgeDoc_2009to2010_rvUpdates.csv", na.strings = "") %>%
  # format date as date
  mutate(
    captureDate = mdy(Date)
  ) %>%
  relocate(captureDate, .after = animalName) %>%
  # add animalIDs by animalName1
  merge(., capData_byIndiv_v5[, c("captureDate", "animalID", "animalName1")], by.x = c("captureDate", "animalName"), by.y = c("captureDate", "animalName1"), all.x = T) %>%
  # add animalIDs by animalName2
  merge(., capData_byIndiv_v5[, c("captureDate", "animalID", "animalName2")], by.x = c("captureDate", "animalName"), by.y = c("captureDate", "animalName2"), all.x = T) %>%
  # coalesce animalIDs
  mutate(
    animalID = coalesce(animalID.x, animalID.y),
    .keep = "unused"
    ) %>%
  # reformat things
  select(-Name, -Date) %>%
  relocate(c(animalID, animalName, captureDate, groupName, A, Notes), .before = Microchip) %>%
  dplyr::rename(
    "age" = "A",
    "microchip" = "Microchip",
    "notes" = "Notes") %>%
  arrange(as.numeric(animalID), captureDate)

# export updated copy
write.csv(capData_dentAgeDoc, "./paper3_demographics/01_dataOrganization/capData_saguinusDentAgeDoc_2009to2010_rvUpdates_v2.csv", row.names = F)

# then filter to first entry per animalID
capData_dentAgeDoc_firstEntry <- capData_dentAgeDoc[match(unique(capData_dentAgeDoc$animalID), capData_dentAgeDoc$animalID),]
```

#### watsaDiss_births

**watsa_table.vi1**

In her dissertation, Mini uses Glassman's (1983) teeth eruption schedule
to estimate ages for all individuals in her study set that were \< 1
year old (see pages 120-121). Below I'm creating a dataframe based on
that data to make it more easily useable in the present context. I'm
also adding the animalID to each entry, assigned after checking the date
in Mini's table against capData_byIndiv captureDate records.

Note that Mini has F53 (SIMP) in her table - she notes that "F53 was not
trapped in the first year of her birth, but was captured the next year
and is most likely the twin of F52" (p. 121). Given that only three
individuals from this group were captured the following year (2012), and
animalID 88 (SPW) was the only individual not captured the year prior
(2011), that would suggest that animalID 88 is F53. However, I don't
have any samples for this individual (sampleNotes in xtnMaster_hair say
I couldn't find an envelope for animalID 88/SPW, and longmires weren't
taken before 2013).

```{r}

### 8.2.3 birthYear_est

Maybe should assign birth year for juveniles as like, 1-Jan-xxxx? I'm
thinking here about how the birth season is Aug-Feb (most in Oct, Dec,
Jan) for LWED and Nov-March (most in Nov, Dec) for SIMP. But if FRANz is
just using the year (vs. the date), that might present an issue -- e.g.,
if indiv1 is born late 2010 and indiv2 is born early 2011, FRANz would
say indiv2 is 1 year older than indiv1 even though they're basically the
same age

april-sept = dry season = most likely mating season - indiv1 born late
2010 = birthYear 2010 = age 3 (repMature) in 2013 for FRANz; but in
reality they'd still be immature for 2013's mating season - indiv2 born
early 2011 = birthYear 2011 = age 3 (repMature) in 2014 for FRANz; lines
up better with age relative to mating season/rep maturity

Maybe should just include birth years for juveniles? Specifically,
individuals in capData that are explicitly noted to have deciduous teeth
(or perhaps if permanents are noted as just coming in) -- ageClass is
sometimes noted, but I'm not always confident in its accuracy -
basically, rule would be that if trapping sheet notes something about
deciduous teeth, I would set the estimated birth year to that year
(giving a normalized bday of 1-jan-year).

#### birthYear_v1

Create starting df for birth year estimates

```{r}
# create birth year col & add capData_dentitionAgeing_2009.2010 doc notes

# export for records
write.csv(birthYear_capData_tamRun5_v1, "./paper3_demographics/01_dataOrganization/birthAssignments_capData_tamRun5_v1.csv", row.names = F)
```

#### birthYear_v2

First I'm going to add birth year estimates based on the following:

1)  For birth dates already assigned in watsaDiss, assign birth year as
    that of 1-Jan for that birth season
2)  For entries in which notes_RV mention "deciduous" or "baby", assign
    birth year as 1-Jan of their captureDate (any indiv that still has
    deciduous teeth would have to have been born in that year's birth
    season (vs. the one prior); as such, their birthDate_est can be set
    to Jan 1st of their captureDate); also note that I checked to see if
    any captures occurred after august (bc then the birthYear would need
    to be that of the following year), but all good

This leaves us with 39 entries that have not been assigned a
birthYear_est, but are noted as "juvenile" in capData - I'm going to go
through these manually in excel

```{r}
birthYear_capData_tamRun5_v2 <- birthYear_capData_tamRun5_v1 %>%
  # add birthYear_est based on miniDiss
  mutate(
    birthDate_est = NA,
    age_watsaDiss_months = as.numeric(age_watsaDiss_months)
  ) %>%
  relocate(birthDate_est, .before = birthYear_est) %>%
  mutate(
    birthDate_est = as.Date(captureDate) - (age_watsaDiss_months*30)
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    # round to nearest year (Jan 1st of whatever year)
    birthYear_est = case_when(
      !is.na(age_watsaDiss_months) ~ round_date(as.Date(birthDate_est), "year")
    ),
    # convert to character & subset string to year only
    birthYear_est = substr(as.character(birthYear_est), 1, 4)
  ) %>%
  
  # add birthYear_est based on "deciduous" or "baby" in notes_RV
  mutate(
    birthYear_est = case_when(
      is.na(age_watsaDiss_months) & str_detect(notes_RV, "decid") ~ substr(as.character(captureDate), 1, 4),
      is.na(age_watsaDiss_months) & str_detect(notes_RV, "baby") ~ substr(as.character(captureDate), 1, 4),
      .default = birthYear_est
    )
  )

birthYear_capData_tamRun5_v2 %>%

```

#### birthYear_v3

Below I'm going through the 39 entries that are designated as "juvenile"
in capData, but could not be confirmed as such through Mini's
dissertation or via notes_RV confirming the presence of "deciduous" or
"baby" teeth.

For each entry, I'm doing the following checks to confirm their juvenile
designation: 1) Check notes_RV for dentition notes that confirm juvenile
dentition outside of "deciduous" or "baby" 2) Double check trapping
sheets to ensure that there werent dentition notes that I had missed
(and fill in on google sheet if I did) 3) Check notes_RV for
non-dentition confirmation of juvenile status 4) Checking trapping
reports for confirmation of juvenile status

In doing so, I was able to confirm juvenile status (and thus assign
birthYear_est) for 38/39 individuals. The only individual whose juvenile
designation is likely incorrect is rowID 1/GBR/animalID 100 - despite
being listed as juvenile, Animal Pic Log_7-21-10 and notes_dentAgeDoc
suggest subadult to young adult.

This gives a total of n = 121 juveniles with birthYear_est confirmed.

#### birthYear_v4 [NOT FINISHED- necessary?]

According to Mini's dissertation:

## 8.3 deathYear_est

### 8.3.1 Data

#### capData

One individual died during trapping in 2012; rowID 118, animalID 87 -
this individual is present in the tamRun5 dataset

```{r}
View(capData_byIndiv_v5 %>%
       filter(str_detect(notes_RV, "(?i)death", )))

View(md_tamRun5_v3 %>%
       filter(animalID %in% 87))
```

#### animalPicLog

(on google drive 2009-2010 trapping folder: Animal Pic Log_7-21-10)

-   In Animal Pic Log_7-21-10, GBW [animalID 118] noted as "deceased?
    Was a major player because he refused to be trapped for a long
    while. He watched the twins while others would enter traps Went
    missing 01/18/10" (p. 5)
-   animalPicLog notes that BBO [animalID 119] was hella old, age listed
    as "estimate 6-8 years or older, now dead) -- can't find a date for
    death though, maybe 2010? \>\> go with 2010

#### watsaDiss_deaths

**watsa_table.vi2_deaths (p. 196)**

F10 from group SF1 listed as dead as of 2011 (confirmed in-text p.
220) - F10 = animalID 117

**watsa_table.vi3_deaths**

111 - dead by 2011 125 - dead july 2010 126 - dead july 2010 109 -
dead/disappeared from group by 2012 89 - dead soon after second capture
[in 2012] 102 - dead/disappeared from natal group [in 2011?]

```{r}
watsa_table.vi3_deaths <- watsa_table.vi3 %>%
  mutate(
    temp = case_when(
      str_detect(comments, "(?i)die") ~ "dead",
      survival_1yr == "dead" ~ "dead",
      .default = NA
    )
  ) %>%
  filter(temp == "dead")
```

**watsa_table.vi4_deaths**

Subset to entries mentioning deaths in notes

-   F21 = "Both females die after a friaje" - I don't know what this
    means, is F21 dead? \>\> yes; both F20 and F21 are dead ((F20 =
    animalID 120, F21 = animalID 121))
-   F31 = "Group dies after a friaje" - does this mean that all of
    Perro6 is dead?? \>\> yes, looks like Perro6 only has captureDate
    entries in 2010, so I guess that does indeed mean that all of those
    individuals died EXCEPT for F30/115 - found her w/additional entries
    -   put deathYear_est as 2011

Note that this info on deaths is confirmed by **table_vi12 (p. 221)**;
column "demographic events" notes:

-   LWED F20 & F21 from SF2 (Jf) BOTH die during friaje
-   All of SF3 (Perro6) killed by friaje

Other notes of interest from table_vi12:

-   Both females in SF1 (FC) (F10 & F11) nursed infants
-   Multiple primary females in SF5, unable to identify mother

```{r}
watsa_table.vi4_deaths <- watsa_table.vi4 %>%
  filter(str_detect(comments, "(?i)die"))

# all of Perro6 really died? yes, appears so - only captureDate entries in 2010 >> EDIT: all *except* F30/animalID 115, who disperses to Angels/Loners
View(capData_byIndiv_v5 %>%
       filter(groupName == "Perro6"))
View(capData_byIndiv_v5 %>%
       filter(as.character(animalID) %in% c("122", "124", "123", "125", "126", "115")))
```

**watsa_table.vi13_deaths (p. 223)**

Notes from "demographic events" column:

-   F52_SI5 died post-trapping \>\> animalID 87 (see miniDiss_indivKey)
-   F60_SI6 gives birth to twins and then dies \>\> animalID 113 (see
    miniDiss_indivKey)
    -   notes on death are listed w/year2 (2011); table.vi10 notes that
        group splinters in year2 after PBF death; seems like 2012 is the
        year of death?

Other notes here might also come in handy (dispersal events, etc.)

## 8.4 Reproduction data

Per Watsa et al. (2017), a female was considered parous if nipple length
\> 3 mm (LWED) or \> 4 mm (SIMP) \>\> in Watsa 2013, specifies that it's
greater or EQUAL to 3 or 4, and that it's the average nipple length (p.
203)

-   study period 2010-2015
-   LWED primary female avg nipple length = 3.41 +/- 0.79 (range
    2.15-5.60)
-   SIMP primary female avg nipple length = 5.15 +/- 0.94 (range
    3.65-7.45)

Watsa (2013) p. 203 has "Recommended Guidelines for Breeding Status"
which is v helpful, then on pages 205-206 has tables w/rep measurements
and scores for all primary breeding females... let's bring that in here
**check miniDiss_ageAssignments to find group, then assign animalID**

### miniDiss_tables

watsa_table.vi4 from above is useful here, as well as tables VI.5
through VI.11

watsa_table.vi4
