# GTseq_ErrorReport_v3.pl
# by Nate Campbell
# Execute this script in a directory containing .genos files generated using the GTseq_Genotyper_v3.pl script.
# This script summarizes possible null alleles and their sequences within the genotyped samples.  In some instances these sequences are the 
# result of co-amplification of a similar locus and should be ignored.  In other cases they may be the result of an undetected allele (null allele)
# within some of the genotyped samples and a modification of the input file is warranted.  It is up to the user to make these determinations and modify
# the input file accordingly.
# Usage: Include genotyping input file as $ARGV[0] on command line;
