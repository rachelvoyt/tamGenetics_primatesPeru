# tamGenetics_primatesPeru

This project contains the files and scripts associated with data analysis for my dissertation on saddleback and bearded emperor tamarins in Amazonian Peru as well as related projects. At present, analyses are focused on GT-seq (Genotyping-in-Thousands by sequencing) results from tamRun1 (used to optimize the SNP set), tamRun2 (used to optimize wet lab protocols and perform initial comparison between sample types), tamRun3 (the full set samples), and laLab_run1 (the first MinION sequencing run done in Peru). 

I've also included general-use how-to guides on processing and analyzing GT-seq data from Illumina and Nanopore platforms.
