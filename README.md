# tamGenetics_primatesPeru

This project is primarily for the files and scripts associated with data analysis for my dissertation on saddleback and bearded emperor tamarins in Amazonian Peru as well as related projects. 

I've also included general-use pipeline templates to process and analyze GT-seq data from Illumina and Nanopore platforms.
